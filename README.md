## Synopsis

This project is a Plugin to Send Mobile Text Messages using InfoBip API.
Mautic have integration with Twillio only, so, this plugin is a new alternative to the users of Mautic.

## Code Example

The development of this plugin is simples and easy.
I'm using all the structure of the base SMSBundle, in the config file, I point almost all classes to the original Bundle, but, in the API I created a InfobipAPI and pointed in config files, passing the necessary parameters to make work. 

## Motivation

Mautic offers only Twillio API integration and in our project, we use InfoBip to send SMS to our leads, so, I had to work in a solution for this.

## Installation

Put the InfoBipSmsBundle in the plugins folder.
Go to the Configuration -> TextMessages Settings.
Enable Text Message.
Put your user and password of the InfoBip Service and Save.
